# CSS Animations

CSS animations allow you to create dynamic and visually appealing effects on web elements. In this document, we'll cover various aspects of CSS animations.

## Syntax

The basic syntax for CSS animations using the `@keyframes` rule is as follows:

```css
@keyframes animation-name {
  0% { /* initial keyframe styles */ }
  100% { /* final keyframe styles */ }
}

selector {
  animation-name: animation-name;
  animation-duration: duration;
  animation-timing-function: timing-function;
  animation-delay: delay;
  animation-iteration-count: iteration-count;
  animation-direction: direction;
  animation-fill-mode: fill-mode;
  animation-play-state: play-state;
}
```

## Examples

### Basic Animation

```css
@keyframes fadeIn {
  0% { opacity: 0; }
  100% { opacity: 1; }
}

.element {
  animation-name: fadeIn;
  animation-duration: 2s;
}
```

### Animation Composition

```css
@keyframes slideAndFade {
  0% { transform: translateX(-100%); opacity: 0; }
  50% { transform: translateX(0); opacity: 1; }
  100% { transform: translateX(100%); opacity: 0; }
}

.element {
  animation: slideAndFade 3s ease-in-out infinite alternate;
}
```

## Defaults

- **animation-duration:** `0s`
- **animation-timing-function:** `ease`
- **animation-delay:** `0s`
- **animation-iteration-count:** `1`
- **animation-direction:** `normal`
- **animation-fill-mode:** `none`
- **animation-play-state:** `running`

## Exceptions

- **animation-name:** Not specifying a name or using an invalid name will result in the animation not being applied.

## Implementation

1. Define animation keyframes using `@keyframes`.
2. Apply animations to elements using the `animation` property.
3. Specify animation properties like `animation-name`, `animation-duration`, etc., as needed.

## How to Use

1. Create keyframes with different percentages (0%, 100%, etc.) to define the animation's start and end states.
2. Apply the animation to HTML elements using CSS selectors.
3. Adjust animation properties like duration, timing function, and iteration count to achieve the desired effect.

## Animation Properties

### `animation-name`

Specifies the name of the animation.

### `animation-duration`

Sets the duration of the animation in seconds.

### `animation-timing-function`

Defines the timing function to control how the animation progresses.

### `animation-delay`

Specifies a delay before the animation starts.

### `animation-iteration-count`

Determines how many times the animation should run.

### `animation-direction`

Sets whether the animation should run forward, backward, or alternate.

### `animation-fill-mode`

Defines what happens before and after the animation.

### `animation-play-state`

Controls whether the animation is running or paused.

### `animation-range` (Experimental)

An experimental feature for defining a range of keyframes within an animation.

### `animation-range-end` (Experimental)

An experimental feature to set the end keyframe of an animation range.

### `animation-range-start` (Experimental)

An experimental feature to set the start keyframe of an animation range.

### `animation-timeline` (Experimental)

An experimental feature for defining the timeline of an animation.

### `animation-timing-function` (Experimental)

An experimental feature for defining a custom timing function.

CSS animations are a powerful way to enhance user interfaces by adding movement and interactivity. Experiment with different properties and keyframes to create captivating animations for your web projects.

Certainly! Let's dive into the details of all the possible values for each of the CSS animation properties:

```css
selector {
  animation-name: animation-name;
  animation-duration: duration;
  animation-timing-function: timing-function;
  animation-delay: delay;
  animation-iteration-count: iteration-count;
  animation-direction: direction;
  animation-fill-mode: fill-mode;
  animation-play-state: play-state;
}
```

### `animation-name`

- **Possible Values**:
  - A user-defined name for a `@keyframes` animation.
  - Built-in values:
    - `none`: No animation is applied.
    - `initial`: Sets the property to its default value.
    - `inherit`: Inherits the value from the parent element.

### `animation-duration`

- **Possible Values**:
  - A time value:
    - Examples: `animation-duration: 2s;`, `animation-duration: 500ms;`
  - `initial`: Sets the property to its default value.
  - `inherit`: Inherits the value from the parent element.

### `animation-timing-function`

- **Possible Values**:
  - Predefined keywords:
    - `ease` (default): Slow start, fast middle, slow end.
    - `linear`: Constant speed.
    - `ease-in`: Slow start, constant speed.
    - `ease-out`: Constant speed, slow end.
    - `ease-in-out`: Slow start and end, fast middle.
  - Custom cubic BÃ©zier function:
    - `cubic-bezier(n, n, n, n)`: Defines a custom timing function using four numerical values (between 0 and 1).
  - `steps(int, start|end)`:
    - Divides the animation into steps.
    - Example: `steps(4, end)` divides the animation into 4 steps, finishing at the end of each step.
  - `initial`: Sets the property to its default value.
  - `inherit`: Inherits the value from the parent element.

### `animation-delay`

- **Possible Values**:
  - A time value:
    - Examples: `animation-delay: 1s;`, `animation-delay: 500ms;`
  - `initial`: Sets the property to its default value.
  - `inherit`: Inherits the value from the parent element.

### `animation-iteration-count`

- **Possible Values**:
  - An integer: Specifies the number of times the animation should run (e.g., `animation-iteration-count: 3;`).
  - `infinite`: The animation runs indefinitely.
  - `initial`: Sets the property to its default value.
  - `inherit`: Inherits the value from the parent element.

### `animation-direction`

- **Possible Values**:
  - Predefined keywords:
    - `normal` (default): Forward animation.
    - `reverse`: Reverse animation.
    - `alternate`: Forward, then reverse (and so on) animation.
    - `alternate-reverse`: Reverse, then forward (and so on) animation.
  - `initial`: Sets the property to its default value.
  - `inherit`: Inherits the value from the parent element.

### `animation-fill-mode`

- **Possible Values**:
  - Predefined keywords:
    - `none` (default): No special behavior.
    - `forwards`: The element retains the styles of the last keyframe after the animation ends.
    - `backwards`: The element applies the styles of the first keyframe before the animation starts.
    - `both`: Combines the effects of `forwards` and `backwards`.
  - `initial`: Sets the property to its default value.
  - `inherit`: Inherits the value from the parent element.

### `animation-play-state`

- **Possible Values**:
  - Predefined keywords:
    - `running` (default): The animation is playing.
